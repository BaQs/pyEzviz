# Ezviz PyPi

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BaQs/pyEzviz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BaQs/pyEzviz)

Pilot your Ezviz cameras with this module.

### Installing


```
pip install pyezviz
```



## Running the tests
The tox configuration is already included.
Simply launch:
```
$ tox
```

(Do not forget to 'pip install tox' if you do not have it.)
Tests are written in the tests directory.
tests/data folder contains samples of EzvizLife API for tests purposes.


## Side notes

As there is no official documentation on the API, I had to reverse-engineer what is the one used in the Ezviz IOS APP.


## Contributing

Any contribution is welcome, considering the number of features the API provides, there is room for improvement!
